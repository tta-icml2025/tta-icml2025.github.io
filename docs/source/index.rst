Our second workshop on test-time adaptation will be held at ICML 2025 this summer in Vancouver!

**When and Where.** The workshop will be held on Jul. 18! Come join us in Meeting 220-222.

**Scope.** Note the increased scope from the last edition to now encompass test-time updates more broadly.
As a workshop at ICML, it is important to host and cross-pollinate work across different learning settings and domains.

Consider joining us to discover and contribute to the latest on updates after training: *the test begins now!*

Call for Papers
---------------

**Topics** We will welcome and highlight content on test-time and post-training updates:

- opportunities and challenges for test-time updates for specific applications or deployments;
- unsupervised or self-supervised losses for optimization during testing;
- parameterizations of updates to inputs, models, or outputs at any scale and for white-box and black-box systems (including updates to open or closed foundation model systems);
- coping with test-time input shifts (domain adaptation), test-time attacks (adversarial defense), or test-time task changes (online continual learning);
- metrics/datasets/benchmarks to validate and evaluate test-time updates by the changes in performance measures and the computation required;
- adapting large-scale/foundation models (LLMs, VLMs, etc.) to specialized or personalized domains whether by in-context learning / adaptation / continual learning / editing.

**Keywords** Adaptation, Continual Learning, Robustness, Personalization

**Format**
We will welcome submission of short papers (= 4 pages content without the references as well as an (optional) Appendix with an unlimited number of pages). Accepted submissions will be selected for poster, lightning talk (= 1 slide in 1 minute), and oral presentation at the workshop.
The workshop will not include proceedings.

*We welcome the submission of relevant, high-quality, short paper versions of papers accepted to the main conference.*
